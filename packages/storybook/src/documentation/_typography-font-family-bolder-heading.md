Bolder Heading is only used once per page as the title.

Due to losing itâ€™s readability when used in smaller sizes the main rule is to use the below type only from 40pt to 64pt. Also, try to avoid the use of this type as much as possible and only for campaign purposes only and never in combination with the regular heading type as seen further down below.
