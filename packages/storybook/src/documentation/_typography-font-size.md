## Font size

A broad set of text sizes is defined based the 4/8 pixel grid. This set is especially not created with heading names like H1, H2, H3, etcetera because this set is the starting point for all kind of device sizes. As a designer for example you may use the smaller sizes for mobile designs and larger sizes for larger desktop applications.
