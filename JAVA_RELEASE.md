# How to Release the Java Packages

This document describes how Java components of the NL Design System for Rotterdam
are versioned, built, signed, and published to Maven Central. It also defines the
security model, rotation policies, and responsibilities for maintainers.

## 1. Instructions for Creating a Release

Releases are created through GitHub Actions and triggered by pushing a Git tag
following the pattern:

`java-<version>`

Example: `java-0.0.2`

Follow these steps:

### 1. Create a new release From GitHub UI

- Go to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nl-design-system/rotterdam/releases)
- Click Draft a new release
- Tag: create tag. Prefix it with 'java-'. Suffix version from pom.xml but without `-SNAPSHOT`. If `pom.xml` has 0.0.85-SNAPSHOT tag is: `java-0.0.85`
- Title: short summary of the release
- Release notes: highlights of the release.

Click 'Publish release'.

### 2. GitHub Actions publishes to Maven Central

Pushing a tag automatically triggers the release workflow:

[maven-central-sonatype.yml](.github/workflows/maven-central-sonatype.yml)

This workflow:

- Builds the Java modules
- Generates sources & javadoc JARs
- Signs all artifacts using the PGP key
- Uploads them to Sonatype Central
- Auto-publishes them to Maven Central
- Waits until publication is fully complete

### 3. Rotterdam internal Maven caching

It may take some time before Maven caches within Rotterdam’s infrastructure
make the new version available.

## 2. Set Up of the Release Process

Java libraries are published to the official Maven Central Repository:
<https://central.sonatype.com/>

Publishing has been set up based on Sonatype’s documentation:
<https://central.sonatype.org/publish/publish-portal-guide/>

The [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/maven-central-sonatype.yml) used for
Java publishing supports two modes:

### A. Validate-only (manual trigger)

Can be run manually from the GitHub Actions UI.
This mode:

- Builds
- Signs
- Uploads to Sonatype Central
- Waits until validation completes
- **Does not auto-publish**

Useful for verifying that everything is configured correctly.

### B. Full release (tag-triggered)

Triggered by a tag `java-<version>`.
This mode:

- Builds
- Signs
- Uploads
- **Auto-publishes to Maven Central**
- Waits until artifacts are published and indexed

## 3. GitHub Secrets Used for Publishing

Publishing requires several secrets to authenticate with Sonatype and to sign artifacts:

| Secret Name                        | Description                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `CENTRAL_SONATYPE_USERNAME`        | Sonatype Portal Token username (Token ID)     |
| `CENTRAL_SONATYPE_PASSWORD`        | Sonatype Portal Token password (Token Secret) |
| `CENTRAL_SONATYPE_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` | ASCII-armored PGP private key for signing     |
| `CENTRAL_SONATYPE_GPG_PASSPHRASE`  | Passphrase for the PGP private key            |

Sonatype Portal Tokens are created following:
<https://central.sonatype.org/publish/generate-portal-token/>

These secrets must only be stored in GitHub Secrets, never in the repository.

## 4. PGP Signing Key

All Maven Central releases must be cryptographically signed.

### Current Signing Key

- **Public Key Fingerprint:**
  `88E232FB40DA012BA01A77B3118AC35D68EF0314`
- **Public Key URL:**
  <https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/88E232FB40DA012BA01A77B3118AC35D68EF0314>
- The **private key** is securely stored only in GitHub Secrets.
- The key was generated on a development workstation and uploaded to <https://keys.openpgp.org/>.

### PGP Key Rotation Policy

When the responsible maintainer leaves the NL Design System Rotterdam project:

1. A new PGP key pair must be generated by a Rotterdam employee.
2. The public key must be uploaded to <https://keys.openpgp.org/>.
3. GitHub Secrets must be updated with the new key and passphrase.
4. The old key should be revoked or archived securely.
5. The leaving person must be removed from the GitHub repository.

---

## 5. Maven Central Namespace & Sonatype Permissions

Artifacts are published under the Namespace:

`nl.rotterdam`

Ownership of this namespace has been verified using a DNS TXT record on `rotterdam.nl`.

Maintainers with access to the namespace can manage users in the Sonatype Central portal:

<https://central.sonatype.com/>

### User & Token Rotation Policy

When a maintainer leaves:

1. Remove their Sonatype account from the `nl.rotterdam` namespace.
2. Remove their access via the NL Design System Terraform repository:
   <https://github.com/nl-design-system/terraform>
3. A new maintainer should generate a new Portal Token if they are responsible for releases.
4. GitHub Secrets must be updated if the responsible maintainer changes.

## 6. Developer Responsibilities

Contributors working on Java artifacts must:

- Never commit credentials or private signing keys
- Use PRs and follow the release workflow
- Update versions via `mvn versions:set`
- Use the correct tag naming convention (`java-<version>`)
- Ensure their personal Sonatype credentials remain secure
- Remove their own access and tokens upon leaving the project
